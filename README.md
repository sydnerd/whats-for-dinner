## Overview

Are you indecisive? Do you get bored with the same old meals that you cook every single week? What's for dinner? is an application that chooses your meals for you. It is categorized into "Sides", "Mains", "Desserts", and an "Entire Meal" option that includes all three! With just one click of a button ("Let's Cook!"), a randomized meal will display! No more thinking, let the application think for you!!

Here is an image of the page. On the left you can click one of the categories.
